      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        The team started as a student project at the Center for Innovation, IIT Madras. In the short time since inception, we proved our mettle at international Hyperloop competitions. We were the only Asian team at the finale of SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition 2019. Then, competing virtually in European Hyperloop Week 2021, we won the 'Most Scalable Pod Design' award by Zeleros Hyperloop and were in the global top-5 in Mechanical, Propulsion and Levitation award categories. We built our latest pod Avishkar 5.0, during the pandemic through relentless effort. Avishkar 5.0 Pod is equipped with many novel technologies that we built in-house from scratch and emerged in the global top 5 in 3 categories - Electrical Subsystem, Traction Subsystem and The Complete Pod Category in the European Hyperloop Week 2022.
Our team is 77 members strong, and although incredibly diverse, the enthusiasm to learn and work is the common thread across the team. To realise the dream of the Indian Hyperloop, we are working on technologies like Hyperloop infrastructure, pod, magnetic propulsion and levitation, with the scalability of systems as the primary objective.
